This is the basic file structure for all Tucker Lab projects. 
I encourage the use of R Projects, and the main R Project file should be placed here. 
- data: raw data files
- output: processed data files (i.e. tidy data)
- scripts: R scripts. I recommend you follow good practices for naming your files, including using numbering, e.g.:
	- 01_data-cleaning.R
	- 02_exploratory-data-analysis.R
	- 03_fit-models.R
- doc: manuscript drafts
- figs: figures. I recommend you save figure files with the corresponding number in the ms as well as a descriptive title, e.g.:
	- fig1_study-area-map.jpg
	- fig2_occ-by-species.jpg
